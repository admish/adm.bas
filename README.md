This is the first program I ever wrote, sometime around 1991-1992 (I was 13).  My father bought our first computer, a Tandy 1000TX in 1986, which came with several large manuals that taught me how to use it.  

I wrote this in Qbasic on the Tandy 1000TX, and modified lines 10 and 290 by changing `CLS` to `CLEAR` to make it run in Applesoft Basic on the Apple IIe's at school.  I was given a failing grade because the teacher hadn't taught us how to use `LET` statments and refused to look at the book I brought from home stating that I needed to show her an Apple programming book.  I dropped the class and started taking computer science classes again once I reached college.

I was 13, I don't remember why it's in all caps, nor did I assume anyone over 21 would ever see it.

This program will ask this series of questions:
1. ENTER YOUR NAME
1. ENTER YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL
1. ENTER YOUR FAVORITE COLOR
1. ENTER YOUR FAVORITE SHAPE
1. ENTER YOUR FAVORITE FOOD
1. WHAT IS YOUR AGE
1. WHAT IS YOUR WEIGHT
1. HOW MANY PETS DO YOU HAVE
1. HOW MANY BROTHERS AND SISTERS
1. ENTER YOUR GRADE

Then output the following message:

```applescript
