This is the first program I ever wrote, sometime around 1991-1992 (I was 13).  My father bought our first computer, a Tandy 1000TX in 1986, which came with several large manuals that taught me how to use it.  

I wrote this in Qbasic on the Tandy 1000TX, and modified lines 10 and 290 by changing `CLS` to `CLEAR` to make it run in Applesoft Basic on the Apple IIe's at school.  I was given a failing grade because the teacher hadn't taught us how to use `LET` or `IF` statments and refused to look at the book I brought from home stating that I needed to show her an Apple programming book.  I dropped the class and started taking computer science classes again once I reached college.

This program will ask this series of questions:
1. `;N$` ENTER YOUR NAME 
1. `;A$` ENTER YOUR FAVORITE ANIMAL  
1. `;C$` ENTER YOUR FAVORITE COLOR  
1. `;S$` ENTER YOUR FAVORITE SHAPE  
1. `;F$` ENTER YOUR FAVORITE FOOD  
1. `;A` WHAT IS YOUR AGE  
1. `;W` WHAT IS YOUR WEIGHT  
1. `;P` HOW MANY PETS DO YOU HAVE  
1. `;N` HOW MANY BROTHERS AND SISTERS  
1. `;G` ENTER YOUR GRADE  

Then insert `NOT` or `NO` based on the 4 `IF` statements, calculate some very basic math using the 4 `LET` statments, and output the following message.  (I was 13, I don't remember why it's in all caps, nor did I assume anyone over 21 would ever use it.)

> HI, `;N$`.  WE KNOWN A LOT ABOUT YOU.  YOU HAVE `;D$;` SIBLINGS SINCE YOU HAVE `;N;` BROTHER(S) AND/OR SISTER(S).  WE HAVE FOUND THAT YOU LIKE TO EAT `;F$;` AND OFTEN WEAR `C$;` CLOTHES.  WHEN YOU DOODLE YOU MAY DRAW `;S$;`S OR `;A$;`S. AT YOUR HOME, YOU HAVE `;P;` PETS.  
>  
> SINCE YOU ARE `;A;` YEARS OLD, YOU HAVE LIVED ABOUT `;Y;` DAYS. YOU ARE `;T$;`A TEENAGER, AND YOU WILL BE 21 IN `;X;` YEARS  
>  
> YOU WEIGH `;W;` POUNDS OR `;Z` KILOGRAMS.  YOU ARE IN GRADE `;G` WHICH TELLS THAT YOU HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL AT LEAST `;V;` YEARS.
